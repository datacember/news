More Than 20% of Earth’s Plant Species Are Found Only on Islands – And Time Is Running Out to Save Them

Islands have long intrigued explorers and scientists, serving as natural laboratories for understanding species evolution and adaptation. They are also centers of species diversity. While it has been speculated that islands support high levels of global biodiversity, the true extent of this diversity was largely unknown until now.

In groundbreaking research published in Nature, my colleagues and I mapped the diversity of plant life on Earth’s islands. We found that 21% of the world’s total plant species are endemic to islands, meaning they occur nowhere else on the planet.

These findings are critical. Island plants face a higher risk of extinction compared to those on mainland areas. Detailed knowledge of plant species and their habitats is essential for effective monitoring and conservation efforts.

Mapping Island Floras Worldwide
Our study involved an international team of scientists who created an unprecedented database of vegetation information from over 3,400 geographical regions worldwide, including about 2,000 islands.

The definition of an island can be somewhat arbitrary. Conventionally, an island is a landmass entirely surrounded by water and smaller than a continent. According to this definition, Tasmania and New Guinea are classified as islands, but mainland Australia is not.

We discovered 94,052 plant species, or 31% of the world’s total, are native to islands. Of these, 63,280 species, or 21%, are exclusive to islands.

Endemic species tend to be concentrated on large tropical islands, such as Madagascar, New Guinea, and Borneo. In Madagascar alone, 9,318 plant species—83% of its total flora—are unique to the island.

Although fewer plant species were found on oceanic archipelagos like Hawaii, the Canary Islands, and the Mascarenes (east of Madagascar), a significant proportion of their species remain unique to these locations.

For example, two palms endemic to Australia’s Lord Howe Island, Howea forsteriana and H. belmoreana, are among the best-studied examples of sympatric speciation, where species evolve from a common ancestor in the same location. While this evolutionary process has long been hypothesized, examples are rare and valuable for research.

The Norfolk Island Pine (Araucaria heterophylla), named after the tiny island where it is found, is endangered in the wild but is now commonly planted along Australia’s beaches, making it easily recognizable.

Islands Are of Great Conservation Concern
Islands comprise just 5.3% of the world’s land area, yet they contribute disproportionately to global biodiversity. However, island plants are at a significantly higher risk of extinction than species found on mainland areas for several reasons, including:

Small population sizes
Unique evolutionary traits that render them vulnerable to invasive species
Specific habitat requirements
Habitat degradation
Threats from invasive plant and animal species
Climate change
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, 57% of the island-endemic species we assessed are classified as critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, or near-threatened. Alarmingly, 176 plant species endemic to islands are already classified as extinct, accounting for 55% of all known extinct plant species globally. Among these is Hawaii’s vulcan palm (Brighamia insignis), which is now considered extinct in the wild but survives as an ornamental plant in gardens.

Other species may be less fortunate; extinction in the wild could mean permanent loss.

Thus, assessing the conservation status of island floras is crucial. Under a globally agreed United Nations target, 30% of the world’s land and oceans should be protected by 2030. However, we found that only 6% of endemic plant species occur on islands that meet this conservation target.

For instance, New Caledonia, Madagascar, and New Guinea—regions known for their many endemic plant species—have relatively low levels of protected areas.

Protecting Our Island Plants
Urgent action is needed to protect island biodiversity, including expanding protected areas, prioritizing regions with high numbers of endemic species, and implementing habitat restoration projects.

Without such measures, the unique floral diversity of islands may continue to decline, posing severe consequences for global biodiversity.

More research is essential to determine the best conservation strategies for these plant species. Accurate data is vital to guide future conservation efforts and prevent further loss.

Our study serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for targeted conservation initiatives on islands. Many species are on the brink of extinction, and time is running out to preserve this irreplaceable natural heritage.
